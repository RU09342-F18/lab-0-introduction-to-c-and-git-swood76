# Lab-0-introduction to c and git. Basic UART Calculator.

This repository contains all necessary files to successfully run a basic UART calculator such that the following operations are implemented and performed: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Modulus, and other Bitwise Math such as: Left shift, Right shift, AND, OR, XOR, and Invert. 

The repository consists of three files: main.c, math.c, and math.h. Included in the main.c file is the actual implementation of the math function, which is coded in its own file: the math.c file. The math.c file contains and supports the operations listed above that the UART calculator must be able to perform. Included in the header file is the actual prototype of the math function described in math.c and implemented in main.c

## Getting Started

Download C complier or use online complier. Insert code, build the project, and run the program, assuming there are no errors; calculator should prompt user for operation and the required values; as a result, the UART calculator yields an approriate result given for any operation.

### Prerequisites

Must use c compiler for code to be able to run and function properly due to the fact it is written in C syntax. Can use a Online C complier, which can be found through a simple google search, or download an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as CodeBlocks, which is what I used.

## Built With
